Opening a website for checking the closing price of a particular stock and saving that data can be a boring and mundane task. This script automates this daily task. It scrapes the Bloomberg website for the closing price of a stock and stores it in excel spreadsheet along with the stock name and current date. Next time when you run the script, it just appends the data to the existing sheet.

<b>Note:</b> Feel free to edit the script according to your requirement for a different stock of a different website.
